  "readme": "# Angular Hint DOM [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular-hint-dom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular-hint-dom) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/angular/angular-hint-dom/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/angular/angular-hint-dom)\n\nThis hinting module is part of the overall tool [AngularHint](https://github.com/angular/angular-hint)\nthat provides advice about AngularJS best practices. Loading this module will provide warnings specific\nto how AngularJS applications should manipulate the DOM.\n\nSee the [AngularHintDOM NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/angular-hint-dom).\n\n##Usage\n\nInstall the [AngularHint NPM module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/angular-hint)\nand use `ng-hint` or `ng-hint-include='dom'` to\nenable AngularHintDOM. Further installation information is available on the\n[main AngularHint repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-hint#usage).\n\n##Features\n\n[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) provides a framework for separating the implementation of a web application into logical components. This separation of concerns is important for code development, maintenance and especially testing. With modular code, it is easy to implement unit tests.\n\nHowever, how an application should be split into these components is not always obvious. For example, many applications built without AngularJS rely on javascript for manipulation of the DOM including dynamically adding and removing elements from the page. Naturally, an AngularJS developer might try to implement such javascript manipulation in their AngularJS controllers. As the controllers provide the logic for the views, this could seem to be a correct usage. However, AngularJS allows all such manipulation to occur through AngularJS directives in the views themselves. In fact, manipulation of DOM APIs from the controller violates the modularity between the controller and view and is against AngularJS best practices.\n\nTo help users recognize the violation of this best practice, AngularHintDOM gives warnings when DOM APIs are manipulated in AngularJS controllers.\n\nFor example, an application might seek to add items to the page based on some changing\nlist of items:\n\n```\n//Application view\n<!doctype html>\n  <html ng-app='sample' ng-hint>\n    ...\n    <div id='list'></div>\n    <script src=\"../../bower_components/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"../../dist/hint.js\"></script>\n    ...\n  </html>\n```\n\n```javascript\n//Application controller\n  angular.module('sample').controller(function(){\n    //Accessing the DOM API `document.getElementById()` triggers an AngularHintDOM warning\n    var list = document.getElementById('list');\n    var newListItem = document.createElement('div');\n    newListItem.innerHTML = 'Item 1';\n    list.appendChild(newListItem);\n  });\n```\n\nThis approach using `document.getElementById()` to access and change the DOM from within the\ncontroller is against AngularJS best practices. The correct approach would be to use the ng-repeat\ndirective to automatically update the list in the view based on the contents of whatever data is\nin the list.\n\n\n[License](LICENSE)\n------------------\nCopyright 2014 Google, Inc. http://angularjs.org\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.",
