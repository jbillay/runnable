This tool is a subset of many under the [Angular Hint](https://github.com/angular/angular-hint) repository that specializes in identifying errors relating to directives. For instructions on how to incorporate the whole Angular Hint repository into your project, please refer to the link above.\n\n#### Angular Hint Modules identifies:\n  - [Modules missing proper namespaces](#missing-namespace)\n  - [Modules created but never loaded](#creating-and-loading-modules)\n  - [Multiple modules created with same name](#creating-and-loading-modules)\n  - [Undeclared modules loaded](#creating-and-loading-modules)\n  - [Using ngView without ngRoute](#ngview-with-ngroute)\n\n#### Missing Namespace\nIt is important for modules we create to have their own unique namespace so as to not conflict with existing modules in Angular or external libraries that may be used. As in the example below, if a module with name 'breadcrumb' was created, you would be warned and prompted to use a more appropriate name that adheres to namespace best practices.\n```javascript\nangular.module('breadcrumbs').\n  directive('myComponent', function() { ... };\n});\n```\n\n#### Creating and Loading Modules\nHint Modules also notifies you of common problems regarding the creation and loading of modules.\n\nThe following code snippit will be the example for the following sections:\n\n```Javascript\nangular.module('createdAndLoaded',[]);\nangular.module('createdAndLoaded',[]);\nangular.module('createdButNotLoaded',[]);\nangular.module('testModule',\n  ['ngHintModules','createdAndLoaded', 'createdButNLoadd','iDontEvenexist']);\n\n```\nIn the example above you would be warned that:\n- The `createdButNotLoaded` module was created but that it was never loaded into the application.\n- The `createdButNLoadd` module was not found and that you should try `createdButNotLoaded`.\n- The `createdAndLoaded` module name was used twice and the first will be overwritten.\n- The `iDontEvenexist` module was loaded but it was never created.\n\n#### ngView with ngRoute\nAfter routing was seperated from Angular.js, it was required to have `ngRoute` as a dependency for your main module. Since this change, `ngRoute` often got left out, so this module also notifies you if you have routing in your application without requiring `ngRoute`.\n\n## [License](LICENSE)\n\nCopyright 2014 Google, Inc. http://angularjs.org\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
