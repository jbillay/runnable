  "readme": "# jasmine-matcher-wrapper\n\nThis is a Jasmine 2.0 helper for users who want to use legacy Jasmine 1.x matchers under Jasmine 2.0.\n\nThis may be particularly useful to anyone who publishes Jasmine support libraries and wants to maintain support of both Jasmine 1.x and 2.x simultaneously.\n\n[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/testdouble/jasmine-matcher-wrapper/releases/latest)\n\n## Usage\n\nUsage is really easy.\n\nSay that you have some jasmine 1.x matchers in an object:\n\n``` javascript\nvar jasmine1Matchers = {\n  toBeNamed: function(name) {\n    var color = this.actual;\n    this.message = function() {\n      return \"expected foo to be \" + name + \" but was \" + color.name;\n    };\n    return color.name === name;\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAnd you want to use them in jasmine 2.x, which provides a `jasmine.addMatchers` function (absent from jasmine 1.x). After loading jasmine-matcher-wrapper you can:\n\n``` javascript\njasmine.addMatchers(jasmine.matcherWrapper.wrap(jasmine1Matchers));\n```\n\nAnd now a failing spec like this:\n\n```\nexpect(name: \"yellow\").toBeNamed(\"red\")\n```\n\nWill both fail the test and print out the message you would expect:\n\n```\nexpected foo to be red but was yellow\nError: expected foo to be red but was yellow\n    at stack (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:1293:17)\n    at buildExpectationResult (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:1270:14)\n    at Spec.Env.expectationResultFactory (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:484:18)\n    at Spec.addExpectationResult (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:260:46)\n    at Expectation.addExpectationResult (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:442:21)\n    at Expectation.toBeNamed (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:1209:12)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (http://localhost:7357/generated/js/spec.js:22:10)\n    at attemptSync (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:1510:12)\n    at QueueRunner.run (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:1498:9)\n    at QueueRunner.execute (http://localhost:7357/testem/jasmine2.js:1485:10)\n```\n",
